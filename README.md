## Mission

Deliver a consistent user experience, open source ecosystem, and platform services that allow any engineer in the world:

- to go from inadequate monitoring
- to complete instrumentation of their environment
- to realizing a win with New Relic

in 5 minutes or less.

## Commands

### Linux/MacOS
```bash
# Installs the newrelic-cli and invokes the install command
# Replace <API_KEY> AND <ACCOUNT_ID> with your own
curl -Ls https://download.newrelic.com/install/newrelic-cli/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install

## Docs

Project documentation can be found under [docs](docs/README.md).

## Testing

The testing of recipes is automated, and those are tested on a freshly provisioned environment and re-provisioned on every test run.

Test definitions files are located under the path [test/definitions](test/definitions). Those definitions are used with the [Deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) to provision all the required resources, run the recipe installation, validate the installation is feeding data into newrelic, and finally teardown all the provisioned resources.

More information about the test framework testing can be found at [Test Framework](docs/test-framework/README.md).

### Manual testing

Refer to [Manual Testing instructions](test/manual/readme.MD)
