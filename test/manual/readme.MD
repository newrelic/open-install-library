# Manual testing

The recipe installation can be tested manually. To do so, the Deployer can be used to provisioned new hosts in AWS, using similar setup than the automated tests, without any instrumentation installed on them.

## Provision new set of hosts

Get the latest docker image of the Deployer

```bash
docker pull newrelic/deployer:latest
```

Then start the provisioning of all hosts using the Deployer in batch mode.

Run the snippet below after replacing:

* The path `<absolute_path>` with the absolute path to the manual `definitions` folder (docker requires absolute path for mounting directories)
* The file `<my_user_config_filename>.json` with your actual deployer user config filename (assumed to be in your ~/configs folder)

```bash
docker run -i \
-v ~/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/ \
-v <absolute_path>/definitions/:/mnt/deployer/definitions/ \
--entrypoint ruby newrelic/deployer:latest batch.rb -c configs/<my_user_config_filename>.json -d definitions -s 20 -m deploy -l debug
```

## Testing

Once all hosts are provisioned, you can SSH to the instance, and run the newrelic-cli as indicated from the UI.

## Auto Config Default Params

Use the `ohi-auto-config` directory for provisioning instances with integrations already configured. When running `newrelic install`, these are the values to be used with the CLI prompts:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/ \
  -v <absolute_path>/open-install-library/test/manual/definitions/ohi-auto-config/:/mnt/deployer/ohi-auto-config/ \
  --entrypoint ruby newrelic/deployer:latest batch.rb -c configs/<my_user_config_filename>.json -d ohi-auto-config -s 20 -m deploy -l debug
```

## Windows

For the Windows host, you'll want to get the password from the AWS Console. While on the EC2 UI, right click the Windows instance, and click Connect. Then use your pem key to decrypt the password.
Once you have the password, use a `Remote Desktop Connection` client with the credential `Administrator` and the password you've decrypted in AWS.

## Tearing down

To teardown all the hosts, re-run the deployer in batch mode with the option `-m teardown` (instead of `-m deploy`).

Run the snippet below after replacing:

* The path `<absolute_path>` with the absolute path to the manual `definitions` folder (docker requires absolute path for mounting directories)
* The file `<my_user_config_filename>.json` with your actual deployer user config filename (assumed to be in your ~/configs folder)

```bash
docker run -i \
-v ~/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/ \
-v <absolute_path>/definitions/:/mnt/deployer/definitions/ \
--entrypoint ruby newrelic/deployer:latest batch.rb -c configs/<my_user_config_filename>.json -d definitions -s 20 -m teardown -l debug
```

## macOS

NOTICE: According to [Apple's SLA](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/), macOS should only be virtualized on a macOS system using official Apple hardware. Apart from legal reasons, the virtualization will simply not work in most other environments.

Install the required software:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Initialize a working directory and Vagrantfile:
```
mkdir macos-catalina
cd macos-catalina
vagrant init ramsey/macos-catalina
```

Add this line to the Vagrantfile (within the "Vagrant.configure" block of code):
```
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
```

Start the local instance:
```
vagrant up
```

Once started, there are two forms of access:
- ssh: while in the macos-catalina folder, run: `vagrant ssh`
- GUI: open the VirtualBox application, select the macos-catalina host and click Show (the vagrant user has password: `vagrant`)

This method of running a macOS host uses a [public GitHub project](https://github.com/ramsey/macos-vagrant-box) based off [macinbox](https://github.com/bacongravy/macinbox).

## Ansible install scripts with Vagrant

Our install scripts can be used locally through the following steps.

Create a working directory:
```
mkdir vagrant-ansible-test
cd vagrant-ansible-test
```

Initialize a new Vagrantfile and playbook:
```
vagrant init bento/debian-10
touch playbook.yml
```

Edit the contents of the playbook:
```
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  roles:
    - ROLENAME
```

Add Ansible provisioning section to the Vagrantfile:
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # Add this section to use the playbook
  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
    ansible.extra_vars = {
      create_newrelic_user: true # required for some install scripts
    }
  end
end
```

Create roles directory:
```
mkdir -p ./roles/ROLENAME/tasks
```

Download a task file (i.e. Apache) to this directory:
```
curl -sLo ./roles/ROLENAME/tasks/main.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/open-install-library/main/test/deploy/linux/apache/install/debian/roles/configure/tasks/main.yml
```

Smoke test:
```
vagrant up && vagrant destroy -f
```
