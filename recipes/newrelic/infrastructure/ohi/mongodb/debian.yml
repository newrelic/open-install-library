      To capture data from the MongoDB integration, you'll first need to meet these prerequisites:
      - MongoDB version requirement (see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb-monitoring-integration#comp-req)
      - User with clusterMonitor and listCollections roles

      In the MongoDB shell, execute the following commands to create a
      listCollections role and a new user, then assign clusterMonitor and
      listCollections roles to the new user.
      Note: username, password, and similar user-specific values must be replaced.

      In the MongoDB shell run the following command
      > rs.initiate()

      Switch to the admin database
      > use admin

      Use the following command to create the listCollections role:
      > db.createRole({role: "listCollections", privileges: [{ resource: {db:"",collection:""}, actions: ["listCollections"] }], roles: []})

      Use the following commands to create a new user, and assign clusterMonitor and listCollections roles to the user:
      > db.createUser({ user: "username", pwd: "password", roles: [ "clusterMonitor", "listCollections" ]})
