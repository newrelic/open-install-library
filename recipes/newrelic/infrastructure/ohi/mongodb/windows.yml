      To capture data from the MongoDB integration, you'll first need to meet these prerequisites:

      - MongoDB 4.0 or higher.
      - MongoDB user account with 'clusterMonitor' and 'readAnyDatabase' roles.

      For a complete list of requirements, go to:
      https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb/mongodb-monitoring-integration-new/#req

      MongoDB User Account Setup
      In the MongoDB shell, execute the following commands to create a
      new user and assign the clusterMonitor and readAnyDatabase roles to it.
      Note: username, password, and similar values are user-specific values must be replaced.

      Switch to the admin database:

      > use admin

      Use the following command to create a new user and assign clusterMonitor and readAnyDatabase 
      roles to the user (adjust the username and password as required):

      > db.createUser(
          {
            user: "username",
            pwd:  "password",
            roles: [ 
              { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" },
              { role: 'readAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' }
            ]
          }
        )
