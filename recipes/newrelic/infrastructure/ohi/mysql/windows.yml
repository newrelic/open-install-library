      To capture data from the MySQL integration, we need to create a new MySql user with specific permissions (REPLICATION, SELECT).
      The installation will create a strong randomly generated password for that new user.
      This installation may prompt for your MySql root user password in order to create this new user.
      More information regarding the prerequisites can be found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mysql-monitoring-integration#req
