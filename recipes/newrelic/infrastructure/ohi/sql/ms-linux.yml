    To capture data from the Microsoft SqlServer integration, we need to create a new SqlServer user with specific permissions (CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, READ).
    The installation will create a strong randomly generated password for that new user.
    Note, this installation requires Sql Server Authentication, also referenced as Mixed mode.
