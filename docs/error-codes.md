# Error Codes

The following page list all the various error codes the newrelic-cli(install) can return,
Please note, some error code values may be generated by other downstream processes. For example, an error code value of 1 may be generated through various executions. It can be generated because an On-Host Integration noticed the infra structure agent is not installed. But that value could also be generated when starting up the infrastructure agent un-successfully.
