# Recipe files schema

Recipe files are written in YAML and adhere to the specifications outlined below.

## Filename format

Recipe definition files are placed under `recipes/org/<on_host_integration_name>` and should have the following format:

> Note: TBD on final format

`<installTargetOS>.yml`

For example:

`recipes/newrelic/infrastructure/awslinux.yml`
`recipes/newrelic/infrastructure/ohi/nginx/awslinux.yml`

TBD - determine naming scheme when the a given recipe can be distro/os agnostic.

## Schema definition

# CLI runs process detection; this is a regex used to filter recipes that are appropriate for matched processes.
# An empty list signifies the recipe will always be run during guided install.
